      <description>I am excited to announce that the WeCountCOVID19.com survey is live!
I am so excited to describe the WeCountCOVID19.com survey in detail, and to ask you to use it. I’m so excited for this, in fact, that I’m writing a blog post for the first time in more than a year! In this time, I’ve been volunteering lots of my time as a co-founding member and the Communications Lead at Code for Milwaukee, which is Wisconsin’s only Code for America brigade, aiming to enhance the delivery of public services to help make Milwaukee a safer, healthier, and more fun place to live.</description>

      <description>This website is now live! I spent several hours at Rokkincat’s Hack &amp;amp; Tell reading more about blogdown and netflify, and toying with a few settings.
One big thing that I’ve been wanting to do is start a catalogue of the data science activities in Milwaukee. There is a lot of beauty in Milwaukee, and also a lot of need. The MKE community also has many talented professions working Saturdays on side projects and hobbies that make Milwaukee a better place.</description>
