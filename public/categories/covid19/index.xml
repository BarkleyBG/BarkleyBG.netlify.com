      <description>I am excited to announce that the WeCountCOVID19.com survey is live!
I am so excited to describe the WeCountCOVID19.com survey in detail, and to ask you to use it. I’m so excited for this, in fact, that I’m writing a blog post for the first time in more than a year! In this time, I’ve been volunteering lots of my time as a co-founding member and the Communications Lead at Code for Milwaukee, which is Wisconsin’s only Code for America brigade, aiming to enhance the delivery of public services to help make Milwaukee a safer, healthier, and more fun place to live.</description>
