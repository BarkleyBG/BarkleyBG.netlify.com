      <description>I work as a marketing data scientist for Kohl&amp;rsquo;s in Milwaukee. I earned a PhD in Biostatistics from UNC-Chapel Hill, studying causal inference from observational studies of infectious disease. I also hold degrees from UW-Milwaukee and Kalamazoo College. I enjoy solving real problems with data in a repdroducible manner, and handing working code with good comments and documentation off to others.
I love music and being outside. One day I&amp;rsquo;ll become an eccentric surfer dude on the shores of Lake Michigan.</description>

      <description> Back to it Hi all, I’m excited to get back to social media! I took a short break in 2018 to earn my PhD, move across the country, and start my career in data science. I’m happy to report that Kohl’s is treating me well, and I am excited for what we have planned.
