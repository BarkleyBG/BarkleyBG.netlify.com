<p>I am excited to announce that <strong>the <a href="www.WeCountCOVID19.com">WeCountCOVID19.com</a> survey is live!</strong></p>
<p>I am so excited to describe the <a href="www.WeCountCOVID19.com">WeCountCOVID19.com</a> survey in detail, and to ask you to use it. I’m so excited for this, in fact, that I’m writing a blog post for the first time in more than a year! In this time, I’ve been volunteering lots of my time as a co-founding member and the Communications Lead at <a href="https://codeformilwaukee.org/">Code for Milwaukee</a>, which is Wisconsin’s only Code for America brigade, aiming to enhance the delivery of public services to help make Milwaukee a safer, healthier, and more fun place to live. More on this later.</p>

<h2>About the <a href="www.WeCountCOVID19.com">WeCountCOVID19.com</a> survey</h2>
<p>The <a href="www.WeCountCOVID19.com">WeCountCOVID19.com</a> survey aims to count every single Wisconsinite who is possibly infected by the coronavirus. It is a “symptom survey”, asking basic questions about how you’re feeling and how long you’ve been ill. <strong>The survey is anonymous, takes 5 minutes, and you can take it from your computer or mobile device</strong>.</p>
<p>So my big request is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you’re sick, please take this survey!</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you’re not sick, please share the survey with your friends and family!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for helping to promote this survey. We need more responses to help uncover where and what the symptoms of COVID-19 are. When you visit <a href="www.WeCountCOVID19.com">WeCountCOVID19.com</a>, you’ll notice that <strong>we are creating analysis reports and sharing results of from the survey.</strong></p>
<p>Why should you care? The survey is important because every voice counts. We ALL count. This survey aims to help individuals’ voices be heard by policymakers, government officials, loca business owners, and anyone who visits the website.</p>
